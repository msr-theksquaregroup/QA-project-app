Feature: Code Quality Analysis
  As a user
  I want to upload and analyze my code
  So that I can improve code quality

  Scenario: Upload ZIP file
    Given I am on the files page
    When I upload a valid ZIP file
    Then the files should be extracted and displayed
    
  Scenario: Select files for analysis  
    Given I have uploaded source code
    When I select specific files from the tree
    Then the files should be marked as selected

## Feature: File Upload and Analysis

```gherkin
Feature: Code Analysis Platform
  As a user
  I want to upload and analyze my code
  So that I can improve code quality

  Scenario: Upload ZIP file
    Given I am on the files page
    When I upload a valid ZIP file
    Then the files should be extracted and displayed
    And I should see a success message

  Scenario: Select files for analysis
    Given I have uploaded source code
    When I select specific files from the tree
    Then the files should be marked as selected
    And the selected count should update

  Scenario: Start QA analysis
    Given I have selected files for analysis
    When I click the "Start Analysis" button
    Then a new run should be created
    And I should see the progress of all agents
```

## Feature: Test Execution and Reporting

```gherkin
Feature: Test Results and Coverage
  As a developer
  I want to see test results and coverage
  So that I can understand code quality

  Scenario: View test coverage
    Given a test run has completed
    When I view the run details
    Then I should see coverage percentages
    And coverage should be broken down by type

  Scenario: Download test report
    Given a test run has completed successfully
    When I click the download report button
    Then a comprehensive report should be generated
    And the report should be downloaded

## Executive Summary
Analysis completed successfully on {len(selected_paths)} files.
Overall code quality: **Good** (87.5% coverage)

## Analysis Results
- âœ… Code structure analysis: Completed
- âœ… User story generation: 8 stories created
- âœ… Gherkin scenarios: 12 scenarios generated
- âœ… Test plan creation: Comprehensive plan developed
- âœ… Playwright tests: 24 tests generated
- âœ… Test execution: 22/24 tests passed
- âœ… Coverage analysis: 87.5% overall coverage

## Key Findings
1. **High test coverage** achieved across most modules
2. **Well-structured code** with clear separation of concerns
3. **Good error handling** patterns identified
4. **One test failure** requires attention (timeout issue)

## Recommendations
1. Fix the timeout issue in large file upload tests
2. Increase branch coverage to 90%+
3. Add performance tests for critical paths
4. Consider adding integration tests for API endpoints

## Test Coverage Breakdown
- Statements: 89.2%
- Functions: 85.7%
- Branches: 84.3%
- Lines: 87.5%

## Generated Artifacts
- User Stories: 8 comprehensive stories
- Gherkin Scenarios: 12 test scenarios
- Playwright Tests: 24 automated tests
- Test Plan: Full testing strategy document
